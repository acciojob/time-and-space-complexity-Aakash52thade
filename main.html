	<h1>Understanding Time, Space and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size. 
    Understanding time complexity helps in writing <em>efficient</em> code that performs well at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. 
    For example, storing elements in an array has a Space Complexity of O(n).
